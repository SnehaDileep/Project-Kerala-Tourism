				<p>Trivandrum (official name Thiruvananthapuram), lying on the southwest coast of India, is the capital to the state of Kerala. The place is well connected to most of the other major cities of India through rail, road, and air network.Because of its proximity to the sea, the climate of Trivandrum is tropical.
